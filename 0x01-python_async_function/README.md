# 0x01. Python - Async

This project focuses on asynchronous programming in Python using the `asyncio` module. It covers concepts such as coroutines, tasks, and measuring execution time of asynchronous functions.

## Files

- `0-basic_async_syntax.py`: Contains a coroutine that waits for a random delay.
- `1-concurrent_coroutines.py`: Implements a function to spawn multiple coroutines.
- `2-measure_runtime.py`: Measures the total execution time for wait_n.
- `3-tasks.py`: Creates an asyncio.Task from a coroutine.
- `4-tasks.py`: Alters the wait_n function to use task_wait_random.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- pycodestyle 2.5.x
